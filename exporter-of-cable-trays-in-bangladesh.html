                    <br>
                <br>
                
                    <b>Here are the thing which needs to be consider while <h2><b>installing cable trays</h2></b>
                    </b>
                    <br>
                       <b> Don't Overfill :</b> When installation, never overfill a cable tray; failing to do so could result in a fire or short circuits. Always make an effort to fill it all the way.

           <br><br>
                  <b>Give Space Between Trays :</b> Another vital factor to keep in mind while installing a cable tray in a high-rise construction is to always leave room between your wires and the tray. Simply put, it means to leave some space between your tray placements to make it easier to remove any damaged or unnecessary connections.
                    <br><br>
                <b>Choose Cable Trays as per your Requirements :</b> At all costs, wire stretching during installation must be prevented. There are numerous sorts of cable trays available at Hutaib Electricals for your diverse cable demands, therefore never choose a tray that is the same width and length as your cables.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Routing It Correctly :</b> You cannot overlook the importance of properly routing your cables when installing a cable tray. This is because it may swiftly be destroyed if you give it the incorrect route.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>General cable security advice                    </b><br>
                    <b>Never Bend The Cable Over its Radius :</b> Never bend a cable beyond its radius since this will prevent you from getting the full productivity out of them and will also force you to keep replacing them as a result of the overbending.
                    <br><br>
<b>Protecting your pass-through :</b> In order to accommodate wiring, you may occasionally need to drill holes in furniture, server containers, or other items. When routing wires through plastic, wood, or metal, grommets are essential because these materials occasionally have jagged edges that could cut the cable or damage its insulation. Grommets protect the cable as it passes through this aperture.
<br><br>

<b>Overtighten your cables :</b> Never tie your wires too tightly because this will prohibit the signal from moving through them properly, damage them, and cause your expanse to grow.
<br><br>

In conclusion, Hutaib Electricals is one of the top quality <h1>cable tray manufacturers and exporters in Bangladesh</h1>. The company is known for producing high-quality products that meet international standards, commitment to customer satisfaction, safety and compliance, sustainability, and a strong focus on export.
