                        The present day construction industry has never faced such an urgency for everlasting, safe, and environmentally friendly building materials. One such material is the Galvanised Iron (GI) Lintel that has now become an integral part of every modern infrastructure. This material essentially provides structural support to building openings like entrance doors and windows as well as wall intersections.Thus, it forms the base on which a structure stands. 
                        <br>
                        At Hutaib Electricals, we realise the GI Lintels are of utmost importance for construction and need to provide them with viable solutions that are stronger and more reliable to our clients. In this detailed blog, we will dive into the innumerable benefits of using GI Lintels in today's architectural and engineering projects.

                    </span>
                   
                    <br><br>
                  <b>  1. Super Strength and Durability</b>
                       
                        <br>
                        
                        <span class="para">
                            GI Lintels are made of high-grade galvanised iron, which is tough and resistant to deterioration. These lintels can carry heavy loads and, thus, avoid deformation and are strongly designed for the support of walls above openings like windows and doors.
                            <br>
                            Load Bearing Capacity: GI Lintels offer excellent load-bearing capacity. These can disperse loads accordingly and avert structural failure, thus keeping the building safe and secure.
                            <br>
                            Longevity: GI Lintels are designed to last for long as against other wooden or plain steel lintels that corrode after some time, thus giving lesser support under adverse environmental conditions.
                            <br>
                            GI Lintels offered by Hutaib Electricals are expertly manufactured with quality above all for maximum performance in every construction project.

                            </span>
                        <br><br>
                        <b>2. Corrosion Resistance</b><br>
                        
                        <span class="para">
                            Galvanization is the covering of a layer of zinc over the iron or steel, which offers yet another protective layer against corrosion. This is useful for projects that involve construction in a highly moist area, in coastal regions, and especially within an industrial zone as there is a significant probability of corrosion.
                            <br>
                            Rust Resistance: The zinc coating makes sure moisture and oxygen do not react with the iron inside. As a result, GI lintels get corroded considerably less than the non-galvanized ones.
                            <br>
                            Less Maintenance: The corrosion-resistant properties of GI lintels translate into reduced or lower maintenance expenditure throughout the life of the building. As such, they are cheaper for long-duration infrastructure constructions.
                            <br>
                            Hutaib Electricals focus on the theme of corrosion resistance while our GI Lintels would be ensured to be manufactured under superior grade galvanization.
